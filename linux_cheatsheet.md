# Other Tutorials

* ## How to clone a new repository on the supervisor

    Run the following commands in order:

    * **sudo rm -rf BEAMNode_Prototype2** This deletes the current respository on the supervisor
    * **sudo bash ./enable_wifi.sh** Enables wifi on the supervisor so it is able to fine the new repository from the internet
    * **git clone https://github.com/fmu-zwiers-ecuador/BEAMNode_Prototype2** Clones the new repository onto the supervisor
    * **sudo reboot now** This reboots the pi so that when it comes back on, it disconnects from wifi and connects back to BATMAN

* ## How to connect to the internet via terminal

    ### First, ensure that the wifi is enabled
    * **Tip:** You may need to run **sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager** if any of these commands give you errors
    * **sudo nmcli networking on** This enables all networking functionality managed by the Network manager
    * **sudo nmcli radio wifi on** This enables WiFi radio via NetworkManager

    ### Scan networks
    * **sudo nmcli dev wifi rescan** This forces the NetworkManager daemon to immediately refresh its list of available Wi-Fi
    * **nmcli dev wifi list** This displays available Wi-Fi access points, including SSID, signal strength, and security protocols

    ### Connect
    * **sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "YOUR_SSID" password "YOUR_PASSWORD"** Connects to the specified wifi network
