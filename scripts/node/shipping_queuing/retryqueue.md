**Basic Info**

* **Task Title:** Write queue script  
* **Student(s):** Jaylen Small, Jackson Roberts  
* **Mentor/Reviewer:** Dr. Zwiers and Raiz Mohammed  
* **Date Started / Completed:** February 5th **\-** February 6th  
* **Status:** Done  
* **GitHub Link:** [retryqueue.py](https://github.com/fmu-zwiers-ecuador/BEAMNode_Prototype2/blob/main/scripts/node/shipping_queuing/retryqueue.py)

---

**1\) Summary**

This script requests and queues data from nodes via mDNS.

---

**2\) Goals**

* Main goal: For the supervisor to request collected data from all connected nodes and transfer the data from the nodes to the supervisor. Also to clear the shipping folder in every node after ther data is pulled.   
* How do we know it works? (e.g., can send message between Pis, script runs without error): The scripts runs without error and the logs return the expected output

---

**3\) Setup**

*List what you used and how to set it up.*

* Hardware (Pi model, sensors, etc.): Raspberry Pi  
* Software (OS, Python version, key packages): Python3, BATMAN Protocol, SSH keys  
* Install/run steps:

        python3 scripts/shipping\_queuing/retryqueue.py  
---

**4\) Method**

* In the script the following commands were used: 

        ping \-c 3 \-W 2 {ip} 
    To get the ping connection for every node to sort from strongest to weakest connection

        rsync \--list-only -e ssh {SSH_OPTS} /home/pi/shipping/
    To handle the data transfer between the supervisor and the nodes

* Using those commands together, this script ensures that after checking the directory to make sure it is not empty, each node is queued to transfer data based on how strong its ping connection is  
* In the configuration table, each node has a hardcoded ip address in the script as well

---

**5\) Code**

* Main script(s): scripts/shipping\_queue/queue\_data\_request.py  
* Example run:

**6\) Testing**

* **How you tested it (manual demo, script, unit tests):**  I would run every command individually that I used in the script to ensure that it would return the expected results so that everything in the script will interact with minimal issues  
* **Results (pass/fail, screenshots, notes):** Since I test everything thing individually, the script ran without issue the first try

---

**7\) Lessons & Next Steps**

* In order to bypass entering the password when using the rsync command, I had to set up ssh keys for each pi, here is how I did it(using ip address 192.168.1.4 as an example, but replace this with whatever ip address you need):

  * Step 1 \- Generate an SSH key: ssh-keygen \-t ed25519 \-C "pi@192.168.1.4"

  * Step 2 \- Copy the public key to the remote server: ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.1.4

  * Step 3 \- This is optional but you can test the ssh command to see if it’ll let you bypass the password or not: ssh pi@192.168.1.4

  * Step 4 \- Then run your rsync normally: rsync \-avz pi@192.168.1.4:/home/pi/data /home/pi/supervisor
