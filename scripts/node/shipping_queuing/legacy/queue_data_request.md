**Basic Info**

* **Task Title:** Write queue script  
* **Student(s):** Jaylen Small, Noel Challa  
* **Mentor/Reviewer:** Dr. Zwiers and Raiz Mohammed  
* **Date Started / Completed:** October 20th **\-** November 1st  
* **Status:** Done  
* **GitHub Link:** [queue\_data\_request.py](https://github.com/fmu-zwiers-ecuador/BEAMNode_Prototype2/blob/main/scripts/node/shipping_queuing/queue_data_request.py)

---

**1\) Summary**

Once a day, this script will check the connection of all connected nodes, sort them, then request a data transfer of nodes with the strongest connection to the weakest connection.

---

**2\) Goals**

* Main goal: For the supervisor to request collected data from all connected nodes and transfer the data from the nodes to the supervisor   
* How do we know it works? (e.g., can send message between Pis, script runs without error): The scripts runs without error and the logs return the expected output

---

**3\) Setup**

*List what you used and how to set it up.*

* Hardware (Pi model, sensors, etc.): Raspberry Pi  
* Software (OS, Python version, key packages): Python3, BATMAN Protocol, SSH keys  
* Install/run steps:

python3 scripts/shipping\_queuing/queue\_data\_request.py  
---

**4\) Method**

* In the script the following commands were used: 

  * ping \-c 3 \-W 1 {ip} To get the ping connection for every node to sort from strongest to weakest connection

  * rsync \-avz pi@{ip}:{remote\_path} {local\_path} to handle the data transfer between the supervisor and the nodes

* Using those commands together, this script ensures that each node is queued to transfer data based on how strong its ping connection is  
* In the configuration table, each node has a hardcoded ip address in the script as well

---

**5\) Code**

* Main script(s): scripts/shipping\_queue/queue\_data\_request.py  
* Example run:

\=== Data queue complete \===

* Important snippet:

def main():  
    log("=== Starting daily data queue \===")

    \# Measure latency for all nodes  
    latencies \= {}  
    for name, ip in NODES.items():  
        latency \= ping\_latency(ip)  
        latencies\[name\] \= latency  
        log(f"{name} ({ip}) \-\> {latency if latency else 'unreachable'} ms")

     \# Sort nodes by latency (ignore unreachable)  
    reachable \= {n: l for n, l in latencies.items() if l is not None}  
    sorted\_nodes \= sorted(reachable.items(), key\=lambda x: x\[1\])

    if not sorted\_nodes:  
        log("No reachable nodes. Exiting.")  
        return

    log(f"Best connection: {sorted\_nodes\[0\]\[0\]} ({sorted\_nodes\[0\]\[1\]} ms)")

    \# Request data from best node first  
    for name, latency in sorted\_nodes:  
        log(f"Requesting data from {name} ({latency} ms)...")  
        rsync\_data(NODES\[name\], name)  
        time.sleep(2)  \# small delay between transfers

    log("=== Data queue complete \===\\n")

**6\) Testing**

* How you tested it (manual demo, script, unit tests): I would run every command individually that I used in the script to ensure that it would return the expected results so that everything in the script will interact with minimal issues  
* Results (pass/fail, screenshots, notes): Since I test everything thing individually, the script ran without issue the first try

---

**7\) Lessons & Next Steps**

* In order to bypass entering the password when using the rsync command, I had to set up ssh keys for each pi, here is how I did it(using ip address 192.168.1.4 as an example, but replace this with whatever ip address you need):

  * Step 1 \- Generate an SSH key: ssh-keygen \-t ed25519 \-C "pi@192.168.1.4"

  * Step 2 \- Copy the public key to the remote server: ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.1.4

  * Step 3 \- This is optional but you can test the ssh command to see if it’ll let you bypass the password or not: ssh pi@192.168.1.4

  * Step 4 \- Then run your rsync normally: rsync \-avz pi@192.168.1.4:/home/pi/data /home/pi/supervisor
